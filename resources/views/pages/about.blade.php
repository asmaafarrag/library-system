	<h1>About</h1>
	<h3>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h3>
	<div class="container">
		<p>Some people like to read on a screen. Other people need the variety and artistry, the sight, smell, and feel of actual books.They love seeing them on their shelves; they love having shelves for them.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p>They love taking them along when they leave the house, and stacking them by their bedsides. They love finding old letters and bookmarks in them. They like remembering where they bought them or who they received them from.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p>They want to read in a way that offers a rich experience, more than the words only: the full offering of a book. They are particular about covers, they want to surround themselves with the poetry of good design.</p>
